# Image-Classification-with-CNNs-using-Keras

## Project Description

In this project a CNN model was created and trained to solve image classification problems, in a subset of the popular CIFAR-10 data set, in Keras with a TensorFlow backend.

**The project was carried out according to the following steps:**

- Importing Libraries,
- Processing the Data,
- Visualize Examples,
- Create Model,
- Train the Model,
- Final Predictions.
